**Design Movement:** Clinical Modernism meets African Precision
**Core Principles:**
1. Deep navy + warm gold palette evoking trust, authority, and African warmth
2. Asymmetric split-panel layouts — left anchored text, right floating imagery
3. Data-driven visual language: pulse lines, ECG traces as decorative motifs
4. Generous whitespace with tight typographic rhythm

**Color Philosophy:** Deep navy (#0D1B2A) as the dominant canvas — commanding and professional like a surgical suite at night. Warm gold (#C9A84C) as the accent, evoking Kenyan sunsets and excellence. White text on dark sections, charcoal on light.

**Layout Paradigm:** Horizontal split hero with a large left text block and a circular portrait with an ECG-line frame. Sections alternate between full-bleed dark and warm off-white backgrounds. Timeline uses a diagonal rail rather than a vertical line.

**Signature Elements:**
- ECG/pulse line as a divider and decorative motif
- Circular portrait with a glowing ring and subtle heartbeat animation
- Gold horizontal rule accents on section headings

**Interaction Philosophy:** Purposeful — every hover reveals depth (cards lift, text reveals). Scroll-triggered fade-ins that feel like a monitor coming to life.

**Animation:** Entrance animations via framer-motion: hero text slides in from left, portrait fades in from right. Skill bars animate on scroll. ECG line draws itself on hero load.

**Typography System:** Display: Playfair Display (bold, italic for name) + Body: DM Sans (clean, readable). Hierarchy: 72px display → 18px body.

**Design Movement:** Brutalist Medical — Raw Precision
**Core Principles:**
1. High-contrast black and electric teal on white
2. Oversized typography with intentional collisions
3. Grid-breaking elements — cards that bleed off-screen
4. Stark, unapologetic layout with no decorative softness

**Color Philosophy:** White (#FFFFFF) as the clinical base, black (#111111) for authority, electric teal (#00B4D8) as the disruptive tech accent. No gradients — flat, decisive.

**Layout Paradigm:** Oversized hero with the name in 120px black type overlapping a teal geometric shape. Sections use a 12-column grid with intentional misalignment. Projects displayed as large numbered cards.

**Signature Elements:**
- Large outlined numerals as section markers
- Teal geometric rectangles as accent blocks
- Monospaced code-style labels for technical skills

**Interaction Philosophy:** Snappy — instant transitions, no easing. Hover states invert colors (black becomes white, teal becomes black).

**Animation:** Minimal — only position-based transforms on hover. No fade-ins. Sections snap into view.

**Typography System:** Display: Space Grotesk (heavy 800) + Body: IBM Plex Mono for technical content, IBM Plex Sans for prose.

**Design Movement:** Warm African Minimalism — Earthy Sophistication
**Core Principles:**
1. Terracotta, warm cream, and deep forest green palette
2. Organic shapes and subtle texture overlays
3. Flowing, magazine-style editorial layout
4. Human-centered — the person before the credentials

**Color Philosophy:** Warm cream (#F5EFE6) as the base — like parchment, warm and inviting. Terracotta (#C1440E) as the primary accent — earthy, African, vibrant. Deep forest green (#1A3C34) as a secondary anchor for depth and nature. This palette feels like Kenya — warm, rich, grounded.

**Layout Paradigm:** Magazine editorial — hero uses a large asymmetric image on the right with editorial-style text on the left. Sections use a masonry-inspired layout. Skills displayed as pill tags with terracotta backgrounds.

**Signature Elements:**
- Subtle terracotta grain/texture overlay on hero
- Organic blob shapes as image frames
- Thin serif italic pull-quotes between sections

**Interaction Philosophy:** Warm and inviting — hover states use gentle color washes. Smooth, slow transitions that feel unhurried and confident.

**Animation:** Gentle — elements drift up 20px on scroll entrance. Staggered children animations. No abrupt movements.

**Typography System:** Display: Cormorant Garamond (elegant, editorial) + Body: Nunito Sans (friendly, readable). Hierarchy: 80px display → 16px body.

## Selected Approach: **Clinical Modernism meets African Precision** (Response 1)

Deep navy + warm gold, ECG motifs, asymmetric split layouts, Playfair Display + DM Sans.
This approach best reflects Kevin's dual identity as a clinical professional and a technologist.
